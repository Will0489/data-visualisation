# Web specialisation - research log D3.JS

**Author:** Blommaert William  
**Objective:** Research and log data visualisation using D3.js

## To do

- Finish writing report
- Create final presentation

## Log entries

**29/12/2014 - Updated and tidied up my repository, started my report**

- Cleaned up my repo a little bit, files are separated better
- Started writing my report of things so far

**28/12/2014 - Found another useful tutorial resource**

- [AlignedLeft.com](http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3) has some nice tutorials on how to use D3.js
- It comes in 17 parts, so each section is quite extensive, definitely worth looking at.

**13/12/2014 - Had a look at some reviews**

- I came across some library overviews and D3.js was almost always listed as one of the top ones, if not the first
- Its popularity seems to be thanks to its SVG nature
- There seem to be projects built on top of D3.js such as [NVD3](http://nvd3.org) and [CrossFilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) 

**11/12/2014 - Found a first downside, maybe not as much to me**

- D3.js is not something that gives you out-of-the-box graphics
- It is mainly to load data into the browser in a visually appealing way
- Nothing is pre-made, but that's not really that big an issue

**24/11/2014 - Started reading through tutorials**

- Found a very nice resource for tutorials at [Dashing D3.js](https://www.dashingd3js.com/table-of-contents)
- It pretty much shows the power of D3.js in an easily learned fashion

**14/11/2014 - Had a better look at the syntax D3.js uses**

- The way you write code in D3 feels like jQuery: easy, fast and readable
- Selectors feel exactly like jQuery, it's like they've known each other for years

**09/11/2014 - Implementing D3.js compared to the static and svg chart**

- Playing around with the D3 API to get the same result as js and svg

**23/10/2014 - Made a basic sample project, trying out some things**

- Created a basic project including static bar chart and svg bar chart
- Had a look at more indepth features of D3.js, quite impressive

**22/10/2014 - Looked into Raphaël and Protovis**

- Raphaël is more for vector graphics than data visualisation, it can still be used for the latter however
- Protovis is the predecessor of D3.js, quite interesting to see how they transitioned
- So far there have been no conflicts syntaxwise

**07/10/2014 - Looked into more apis**

- Processing.js and Sigma.js offer similar results like D3.js
- Combining these with D3.js can yield incredible results

**01/10/2014 - Initial research**

- Out of all the apis looked at, D3 offers the biggest support and community
- D3 is known for its powerful visualisations, yet with the ease of being lightweight
