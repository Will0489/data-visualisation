# Web specialisation - research log D3.JS

**Author:** Blommaert William  
**Objective:** Research and log data visualisation using D3.js

## To do

- Create a project using D3.JS
- Combine apis for a greater result

## Log entries

**22/10/2014 - Looked into Raphaël and Protovis**

- Raphaël is more for vector graphics than data visualisation, it can still be used for the latter however
- Protovis is the predecessor of D3.js, quite interesting to see how they transitioned
- So far there have been no conflicts syntaxwise

**07/10/2014 - Looked into more apis**

- Processing.js and Sigma.js offer similar results like D3.js
- Combining these with D3.js can yield incredible results

**01/10/2014 - Initial research**

- Out of all the apis looked at, D3 offers the biggest support and community
- D3 is known for its powerful visualisations, yet with the ease of being lightweight
